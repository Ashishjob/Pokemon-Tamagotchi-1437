# Pokemon-Tamagotchi

## **Description**

&ensp;&thinsp; TamaGatch â€˜Em All is a Pokemon-themed Tamagotchi game where players choose one of three starters (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander) and take care of their selected Pokemon until they evolve (victory) or run away due to neglect (defeat). Players must balance four activities to increase their Pokemon's level while keeping it happy, fed, and healthy. Each starter Pokemon begins with 50% of all stats except for its Level starting at 1, and players receive warnings when stats are at risk. The game includes a save function for players to resume later. 

&ensp;&thinsp; The game's structure includes a base Pokemon class and three derived classes for each starter Pokemon, each with unique effects to the selected Pokemon.
