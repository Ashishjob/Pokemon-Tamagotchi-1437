# Pokemon-Tamagotchi

## **Description**

TamaGatch â€˜Em All is a Pokemon-based Tamagotchi (puns-intended) in which a player can select between 3 Pokemon starters (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander), just like the original Pokemon game, and can grow and take care of their selected Pokemon until they evolve to their final form (a victory), or until the Pokemon decides to run away if not properly cared for (a defeat). The player can choose between 4 activities that will have different results based on their selected Pokemon, and they will have to find a way to increase the levels of these Pokemon while maintaining its happiness, hunger, and health. Each starter Pokemon will begin with 100 happiness, 0 hunger, and 100 health (perfect stats), but it is up to the player to watch out for the activities they have their Pokemon do. They will receive warnings when statuses are at risk and can display stats whenever requested. The Tamagotchi will consist of one base Pokemon class holding the common functions of all characters and three derived classes for each Pokemon option containing the various effects of these common functions. Finally, if the player realizes they have to stop playing, theres a saveGame function implemented that they can pick back up on later if desired.
